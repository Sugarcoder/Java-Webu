/* The 'instanceof' operator is used in comparisons - 
it gives a boolean answer when used to compare an object reference with a class name. */

referenceExpression instanceof ObjectType

// Example: 

if (e[i] instanceof Wizard) ((Wizard) e[i]).castSpell();   // This will be 'true'


// Every object has a getClass() method that returns a class object.



/******************/


// A 'derived class' object's class will compare as "equal" to the base class. 

// Example: 
if (e[i].getClass().equals(Wizard.class))
	((Wizard) e[i]).castSpell();

// Note: It is rare that you would need to conduct this type of test.
