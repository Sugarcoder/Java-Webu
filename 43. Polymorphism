/* If a derived class extends a base class, it is not only considered an instance, 
but an instance of the base class as well. */


// Examples of how to use Polymorphism: 


// For any character that is used in a game, a "Entity" variable could be used: 


Entity shrek = new Orge();
Entity merlin = new Wizard(); 


// For the player's character, a "Playable" variable could be used.


Playable charles = new Prince();


merlin.moveTo()  // This is legal, since that element is guaranteed to be there. 

merlin.castSpell()   // This is illegal, because the "Entity" definition does not include it.


// Example - The compiler would not know what object this code would create: 

Entity x;
	if (Math.random() < 0.5) x = new Wizard();
	else x = new Trill();
