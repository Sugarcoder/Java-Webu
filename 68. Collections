/* Java Collections API is a set of classes and interfaces designed to store multiple objects. 

- Lists interface = Store objects in a specific order

- Sets interface = rejects duplicates of any object already in the collection

- Maps interface = store objects in association with a key, which is later used to look up and retrieve the object


- Enumeration interface = provides a pair of methods that enable you to loop through a collection in a standardized manner

- Iterator interface = allows an object to be removed from the collection through the iterator */



/***********************/



Useful methods for the 'Collection' interface: add(Object o), remove(Object o), contains(Object o), iterator()


Useful methods for the Map interface: 
get(Object key), put(Object key, Object value), remove(Object key), containsKey(Object key), containsValue(Object value), keySet(), entrySet()
