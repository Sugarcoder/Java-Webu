/* A type parameter may set bounds on the type used, by setting an upper limit on the class used. 

The 'extends' keyword is used to mean that the class must either be an instance of the specified boundary class or extends it. If it is an interface, implement it. */


// Example: 

public class EmployeeLocator<T extends Employee> { ... }

public class CheckPrinter<T extends Payable> { ... }
