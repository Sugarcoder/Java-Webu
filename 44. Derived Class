// Syntax for extending a base class to create a new class is: 

[modifiers] class DerivedClassName extends BaseClassName {
	(new or revised field & method definitions go here)
}


// If you do not extend any class, Java assumes you are extending 'Object' by default. 


// Note: Java does not allow multiple inheritance.


/* When a derived class is created, an object of the new class 
will in effect contain all the members of the base class and the derived class. */



// Examples: 

public class MyBase {
	public int x;
	public void show() {
		System.out.printIn("x =" + x);
	}
}




class MyDerived extends Base {
	public int y;
	public void show() {
		System.out.printIn("x = " + x);
		System.out.printIn("y = " + y);
	}
}
