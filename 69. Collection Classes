/* Collection Classes:

- Vector = stores objects in a linear list.

- ArrayList = stores objects in a linear list, in order of addition.

- TreeSet = stores objects in a linear sequence, sorted by comparison with no duplicates. Also stores by Comparable items or use a separate comparator object to determin ordering. 


- TreeMap = stores objects in a Map. (Keys must be Comparable items)

- Hashtable = stores objects in a Map. (All methods are synchronized; predicts the collections framework; extends the Dictionary class)


- HashSet = rejects dublicate entries. */
