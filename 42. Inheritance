/* Inheritance = creates a new class by building upon an existing definition (extending the original class).

When you extend a class, you can add new fields and methods, as well as change the behavior of existing methods (aka overridng).

You can declare a method with the same signature.

You can declare a field again, but it does not replace the original field.  */
